# AFKer
A tera-proxy module that prevents you from getting back to the character select screen.  
Once activated, the server's AFK check will not kick you out of the game.  

## Usage
The script is enabled by default and will prevent you from getting logged out when you are standing still for an hour.  
Simply moving your character will reset the 1 hour timer and make you able to go back to character selection.
